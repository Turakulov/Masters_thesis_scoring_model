## üìå Overview

This project focuses on developing a predictive model for identifying bankruptcy risks in commercial sector companies connected to the **Evotor** online cash register system. Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in forecasting company insolvency.

The study involves analyzing financial and non-financial indicators, incorporating risk flags and average check data obtained from Evotor. A dataset of retail companies from **2020 to 2022** was collected using public financial statements from **SPARK-INTERFAX** and Evotor API calls.

## üèÜ Key Findings

- **Random Forest** demonstrated the highest predictive performance.
- **Logistic Regression with binning** closely followed in effectiveness.
- The **average check amount** and **risk flags from Evotor** proved to be strong predictors of bankruptcy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Algorithms Evaluated

The following classification models were tested:

- **Logistic Regression** (–õ–æ–≥–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Ä–µ–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∏—è)
- **Decision Tree** (–î–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ —Ä–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏–π)
- **Random Forest** (–°–ª—É—á–∞–π–Ω—ã–π –ª–µ—Å)
- **CatBoost Classifier**
- **Support Vector Classification (SVC)** (–ú–µ—Ç–æ–¥ –æ–ø–æ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤)
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (–ú–µ—Ç–æ–¥ k-–±–ª–∏–∂–∞–π—à–∏—Ö —Å–æ—Å–µ–¥–µ–π)

## üìä Data Preprocessing & Feature Selection

Special attention was given to:

- Checking variables for **significance, informativeness, correlation, and multicollinearity**.
- Using both **financial** and **non-financial** indicators.
- Feature engineering using Evotor **risk flags** and **average transaction values**.

## üìà Model Evaluation

To assess model quality, we used **ROC AUC** and the **Gini coefficient**:

\[
Gini = 2 \times AUC - 1
\]

where:

- \( AUC \) (Area Under Curve) is the area under the ROC curve.
- \( Gini \) measures model separation power (higher values indicate better performance).

## üì¶ Data Sources

- **SPARK-INTERFAX** ‚Äî Public financial statements
- **Evotor API** ‚Äî Online cash register transaction data

## üöÄ Conclusion

The **Random Forest model** emerged as the best performer, followed by **Logistic Regression with binning**. This work highlights the **importance of transaction-based risk indicators** in bankruptcy prediction and their potential use in scoring models.
